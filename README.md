# blackboard autosignon oslt sso testing
Script to test SSO for OSLT autosignon

This is for testing the SSO (Single Sign On) (B2) tool available for Blackboard Learn.  

The tool is available from:  
https://github.com/AllTheDucks/oslt-autosignon  
Note that the version tested is not officially released but is available at:  
https://github.com/AllTheDucks/oslt-autosignon/tree/feature/ultra-support   

I have included the original Word document for reference as this explains how to the autosignon tool is set-up on Blackboard Learn.
